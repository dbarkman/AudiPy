# AudiPy Scripts Organization

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Production Pipeline

Run these scripts in order to set up and populate your AudiPy system:

### Phase 1: Authentication
```bash

python phase2_user_profile.py
```
- Sets up user preferences (language, marketplace, price thresholds)
- Interactive configuration of recommendation settings
- **Run second** - configures your personal preferences

### Phase 3: Library Sync
```bash
python phase3_fetch_library.py
```
- Fetches your complete Audible library (696 books in your case)
- Stores books, authors, narrators, and series in database
- Applies language filtering based on preferences
- **Run third** - populates the database with your library

### Phase 4: Generate Recommendations

python utils/view_recommendations.py
```

### Database Cleanup

python utils/cleanup_database.py
```

### Crypto Utilities
```bash

```
- Encryption/decryption utilities for secure token storage

## ðŸ“š Legacy Scripts

Located in `legacy/` directory - these are the original monolithic scripts before the database-driven architecture:

- `audipy.py` - Original CLI-only script
- `audipy_with_token_caching.py` - Enhanced with token caching
- `audipy_interactive.py` - Interactive credential prompting

These are kept for reference but not needed for production use.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Set up your `.env` file with database credentials
2. Run the phases in order: 1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3 â†’ 4
3. View your recommendations with `python utils/view_recommendations.py`
